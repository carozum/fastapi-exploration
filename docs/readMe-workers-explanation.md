The `--workers 4` option in the command you provided (`uvicorn scripts.test-fastapi-simple:app --workers 4 --port 8000`) specifies the number of worker processes that will be spawned by Uvicorn to handle incoming requests to your FastAPI application. These workers are not related to the number of users connected to your app but are instead related to the parallelism of your application server.

### What are Workers?

- **Workers** in this context are separate processes that Uvicorn spawns to handle requests concurrently. Each worker can handle multiple requests simultaneously, depending on how your application is designed (e.g., whether it's asynchronous or not).

- **Parallel Processing**: By running multiple workers, you enable your application to handle more incoming requests at the same time. If one worker is busy processing a long-running request, other workers can still process new incoming requests, leading to better utilization of CPU resources and improved performance under load.

- **Concurrency**: Each worker handles requests independently of the others. If your application is asynchronous (which FastAPI supports natively), each worker can handle many requests concurrently, effectively increasing the throughput of your application.

### Why Use Multiple Workers?

Using multiple workers can be beneficial for several reasons:

1. **CPU Utilization**: On a multi-core machine, you can run one worker per CPU core to make better use of the hardware. This allows the application to handle more requests in parallel.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: If one worker crashes or becomes unresponsive, other workers can continue handling requests, reducing downtime.

3. **Improved Performance**: For I/O-bound tasks, such as waiting for a database response, multiple workers allow the application to process other requests while waiting, leading to better overall performance.

### How Many Workers Should You Use?

The number of workers you should use depends on several factors:

- **CPU Cores**: A common rule of thumb is to set the number of workers to match the number of CPU cores available on the server. If your machine has 4 cores, using 4 workers would allow you to fully utilize the CPU.

- **Application Characteristics**: If your application is I/O-bound (e.g., waiting for external APIs or database calls), more workers might be beneficial. If it's CPU-bound (e.g., doing heavy computations), too many workers might lead to context switching overhead without much benefit.

- **Load Testing**: It's a good idea to load test your application with different worker counts to find the optimal configuration for your specific workload.

### Example in Your Command

In your command:

```bash
uvicorn scripts.test-fastapi-simple:app --workers 4 --port 8000
```

- **`--workers 4`**: Uvicorn will spawn 4 worker processes.
- **`--port 8000`**: Your application will be accessible on port 8000.

This setup allows your application to handle requests concurrently across 4 separate processes, which can help improve performance and scalability in a production environment.

### Summary

To directly answer your question: Workers are not the number of users connected to your app; rather, they are the number of parallel processes that handle incoming requests. This is a way to scale your application horizontally on a single machine, ensuring better performance under load.
